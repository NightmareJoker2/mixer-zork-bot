How to configure
===

Save a file with the name `default.json` in the `config` directory with the following content:

```json

    "Channels": [
        0 // your channel ID or token of the channel you want to join here
    ],
    "Beam":
    {
        "key": "" // your implicit grant OAuth token here
    }
}
```

Adjust the values to your needs, do not add the comments. See `example.json` for an example.
