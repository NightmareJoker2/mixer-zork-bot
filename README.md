Mixer Zork Bot
==============

Play the text-based adventure game [ZORK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) from [Mixer](https://mixer.com/) chat.
This is very crude and doesn't work too well.

Running this application requires a terminal Z-Machine interpreter like [fizmo](https://github.com/chrender/fizmo) and a shell script stub called `zork1` in the global path executing `ZORK1.DAT` from [this ZIP file](http://www.infocom-if.org/downloads/zork1.zip) to make the [`zorkmid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zorkmid) module work.
